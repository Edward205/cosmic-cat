Before contributing, check [Pull requests] to see if anyone is currently working on the same thing you plan to work on.
If you want to help them out, feel free to ask them! Teamwork is good work.

Low-effort pull requests will be closed immediately. As will bug reports.

I should make this clear. Do. NOT. vandalize any of the code. Don't break stuff.

Include name and version of the browser you're using.</br>

Low-effort bug reports will be closed.

Do not suggest stuff or start conversations in Issues.

If you repeat offends, you will be blocked from accessing this and all my Repos. Including the Discord server.
