# Ciulin's YouTube UserScript
#### This userscript aims to recreate YouTube's old layout from 2012.
#### Completely replaces Polymer!

#### I made this to challenge YouTube Redux and be one of the first scripts to truly bring back the original 2012 layout.

## Features
2012 YT Layout!<br/>
Channel 2.0!<br/>
Redesigned Player!<br/>
Play videos directly on someone's channel page!<br/>
See community posts as recent activity!<br/>
Dislike videos!<br/>
And many more!<br/>

## Compatiability
Works best on Firefox!<br/>
Minor things are broken on Chromium/Webkit-based browsers.

## SETUP

Install Tampermonkey for your Browser: https://www.tampermonkey.net<br/>
Download the script: [Ciulin's YouTube.user.js](https://github.com/ciulinuwu/ciulin-s-youtube/raw/main/Ciulin's%20YouTube.user.js)<br/>
Easy!

## Note
This is still all Work-In-Progress - So there are things missing.</br>
If you know JavaScript/CSS/HTML, feel free to contribute!
