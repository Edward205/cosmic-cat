# Ciulin's YouTube
#### This script aims to create YouTube's layout from 2012.
#### Completely replaces Polymer!

#### I made this because I don't like how YouTube Redux barely recreates the old design. And there aren't any other scripts/extensions other than YouTube Redux.

## Features
2012 YT Layout!<br/>
Channel 2.0!<br/>
Redesigned Player!<br/>
Play videos directly on someone's channel page!<br/>
See community posts as recent activity!<br/>
And many more!<br/>

## Compatability
Works best on Firefox!<br/>
Minor things are broken on Chromium/Webkit-based browsers.

## SETUP

Install Tampermonkey for your Browser: https://www.tampermonkey.net<br/>
Download the script: [Ciulin's YouTube.user.js](https://github.com/ciulinuwu/ciulin-s-youtube/raw/main/Ciulin's%20YouTube.user.js)<br/>
Easy!

## Update System
1.2.3<br/>
1 < Major Release<br/>
2 < New Page<br/>
3 < Bug/Minor fixes<br/>

## To-do
#### There are lots of features missing. I'm doing my best to add them all in.

## Disclaimer
I'm not good at coding, so some of my code is unoptimized and could've been written in a better way.<br/>
Feel free to contribute tho! Just don't modify the HTML code ^^;
