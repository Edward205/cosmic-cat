# Ciulin's YouTube
#### This script recreates the 2011-2012 layout of YouTube completely!
#### No polymer used!

#### I made this because I don't like how YouTube Redux barely recreates the old design. And there aren't any other scripts/extensions other than YouTube Redux.

## SETUP

Install Tampermonkey for your Browser: https://www.tampermonkey.net<br/>
Download the script: [Ciulin's YouTube.user.js](https://github.com/ciulinuwu/ciulin-s-youtube/raw/main/Ciulin's%20YouTube.user.js)<br/>
Easy!

## To-do
#### There are lots of features missing. I'm doing my best to add them all in.
