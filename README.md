# Ciulin's YouTube UserScript
[![playground](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/996349883663523881/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/cs6ccRKmjx)

This UserScript aims to recreate the 2012 layout of YouTube completely. Including look and functionality.

## Important
This project is discontinued.<br/><br/>
I'm not a skilled programmer and the code quality in this is bad. I don't know how to impledement most of 2012 YT's features.<br/>
This script will be replaced by a 2012 theme for V3.<br/>
Thank you for your patronage.
